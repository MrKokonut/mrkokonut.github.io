In this project, I was taked to break a complex topic down into simpler terms such that a college freshman would be able to understand it. I choose to explain rocket propulsion, as it is the topic I feel I'm best educated in. Communication of complex ideas is fundemental to all aspects and types of innovation, and through the completion of the project, my understanding of the process of breaking large ideas down into smaller, more managable ones, grew significantly.
