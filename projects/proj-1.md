For this project, I was tasked to break a complex topic down into simpler terms such that a college freshman would be able to understand it. I chose to explain rocket propulsion, as it is the topic I feel I’m best educated in. Communication of complex ideas is fundamental to all aspects and types of innovation, and through the completion of this project, my understanding of the process of breaking large ideas down into smaller, more manageable ones, grew significantly.
