title: 'Project Two: Visual Project'
---

This project is an adaptation of my Undergraduate Research Blog (project 1) to a visual format. In order to accomplish this, I created a PowerPoint presentation that touches on the same key ideas that my blog did, however in a much more consise and focused manner. A large component of the project was the finding or creation of images and figures. I feel that the images chosen significantly aid in the reader's understanding of the topic. By creating this project, I learned a large amount about the depiction of ideas through visual means, and especially how to condense long explanations into more consise and easier to understand peices.
